# Matcha Ice Cream

A proof of concept around creating an automated language translation sequence at the _"build"_ phase level.

Translation is executed via [AWS Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/) as part of a [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) build sequence and absorbed as content in [React](https://reactjs.org/).
